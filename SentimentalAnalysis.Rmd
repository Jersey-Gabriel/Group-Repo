theme_minimal()

#The scatter plot shows that tweet lengths are consistently distributed over time, with most #tweets clustering near the upper character limit (140â€“280 characters). A few outliers with #very short tweet lengths are also visible, likely representing brief or automated messages. #No clear trend or variation in tweet length over time is apparent from the current #visualization.
```

```{r}
# Count the top 10 tweet sources
top_sources <- tweets_df %>%
count(tweetSource, sort = TRUE) %>%
top_n(10, wt = n)

# Bar plot
ggplot(top_sources, aes(x = reorder(tweetSource, n), y = n, fill = tweetSource)) +

labs(title = "Top 10 Tweet Sources",

scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3", guide = "none")

#The bar chart shows the top 10 sources of tweets, with "iPhone" and "Android" being the most #common platforms, contributing significantly more tweets than other sources. "Others" also #accounts for a notable number of tweets, while smaller sources like "iPad," "IFTTT," and #"dlvr.it" have minimal contributions. This suggests that mobile devices dominate tweet #generation, with iPhone slightly surpassing Android in usage.

#The bar graph depicts a positive linear trend in the number of tweets over time.

#The histogram shows the distribution of tweet lengths, with the x-axis representing #the tweet length in characters and the y-axis representing the frequency of tweets of #that length.
#The majority of tweets have a length between 50 and 100 characters, with the peak #frequency occurring between 100 and 125 characters.
#There is a smaller peak in the frequency between 0 and 25 characters, and a very #small number of tweets have lengths greater than 125 characters.
